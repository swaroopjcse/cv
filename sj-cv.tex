\subsection{Ph.D.\ Thesis}
\cvitem{title}{\emph{\thesis}}
\cvitem{advisor}{Prof.\ Neelam Soundarajan, \cse, OSU}
% \cvitem{description}{\con\ is a novel, powerful approach for effective
% collaborative learning in college courses, particularly in computer science
% and other STEM disciplines. The design of the approach is informed by research
% in education psychology, and its key features are designed to overcome some
% known issues in other collaborative learning approaches. We have also
% developed a responsive web app based on this approach, using Google App Engine
% and Python 2.7, which is available as a free and open source software. We are
% using it in several undergrad/grad level CS courses for its evaluation and
% development.}

\cvitem{description}{Piaget's classic work on cognitive development showed that
  engaging learners in critical discussions with peers about ideas that are
  different than theirs leads to deep conceptual understanding. Implementing
  such an approach in college level STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
  Math) courses has some specific challenges: (a) Short meeting times and large
  class sizes; (b) Competitive nature of the courses and single answer questions
  on assignments and exams; and (c) Overall lack of collaborative learning
  culture where students are unsure of how to seek help and many faculty members
  tend to think that engaging in collaborative activities may affect content
  coverage; etc. Based on Piaget's theory, I have developed a highly innovative
  collaborative learning approach that exploits specific affordances of web
  technologies to address these challenges. This approach, named CONSIDER (short
  for CONflicting Ideas Discussed, Evaluated, and Resolved) allows creation of
  small groups of students with different ideas about the topic in question,
  engages them in a highly-structured rounds-based discussion so that the group
  progresses at an equitable pace, and makes their submissions anonymous to
  others so that students can receive the comments without any preconceived
  notions they may have about the poster. While a number of researchers have
  explored approaches to collaborative learning, a key difference with this work
  is that my focus is helping individual students develop their own
  understanding, whereas the focus of much of this other work is on developing
  students' team skills, effective communication abilities, and the like.}
\cvitem{}{A platform independent responsive web application was developed to
  implement this approach and to compare it with the commonly used discussion
  forum approach, where students respond to other posts in a threaded
  discussion. This app was used in three offerings of two junior/senior level
  undergraduate Computer Science \& Engineering courses at The Ohio State
  University, where one discussion was conducted using the forum-based approach
  and the other using my approach in each course. Students performance on the
  pre- and post-discussion question and participation of individual students was
  measured. In two of the studies, significant difference was found in the
  discussion that used the CONSIDER approach, compared to the forum-based
  approach on both these measures: improvement in learning (Study 1:
  $N=37,r=‚àí.63,p<.05$; Study 2: $N=26,r=‚àí.38,p<.05$) and participation (Study 1:
  $r=‚àí.57,p<.05$; Study 2: $r=‚àí.76,p<.05$). In the third study, there was no
  significant effect on the post-activity scores ($p=.37$), and the
  participation in the two types of discussions did not differ significantly,
  either ($r=‚àí.20,p=.09$). In an anonymous, optional post-activity survey, a
  majority of the students self reported that they found the rounds-based
  structure (55\%) and anonymity (80\%) to be helpful in their participation and
  learning.}
