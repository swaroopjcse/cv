## Profile

I am a Researcher and Educator interested in a range of topics in Computing Education, Software Engineering, and Accessibility.
My current research projects focus on (a) teaching how to build accessible software to computing students and professionals and (b) teaching computing to students with disabilities.
I work first-hand with disabled students, their parents, and teachers through these projects.

I am also involved in organising EMPOWER, India's leading conference on Assistive Technology, and Entrepreneurship and Incubation workshops focussing on Assistive Technology.

Students with disabilities form less than 1% of university students in India, which does not reflect their population. We must develop awareness, attitudes, and procedures to enable disabled students to have a college education in various fields and researchers to work on problems relevant to people with disabilities.
